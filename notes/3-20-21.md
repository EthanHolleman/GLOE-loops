# Visualizing R-loop nick distances

## Initial brainstorming

First thing I did was plot the GLOE-seq and footloop intersected data as
histograms. These plots showed the number of GLOE-seq reads at a given
distance from the start of footloop peaks but would only include nicks that
intersect the R-loops which basically gave closest *internal* nick which then
could be viewed by gene.

## Considering upstream nicks

But we are also going to want to consider nicks that are just upstream of the
R-loop initiation sites. This would preclude using bedtools `intersect` function.

So I am thinking could use `closest` function in sort of combination with
intersect. This would first get closest downstream nicks by only allowing
downstream positions, might want to return closest `n` (100? 20?) nicks. Then
combine these results with the intersection results. Would also want to do
a downstream one as well with the same `n` to be fair.

## Considering strandedness

Thinking more about it I am not sure how important the nick strandedness would
be to R-loop formation kinetics and so I adjusted the snakefile to do intersections
for all-against-all in terms of strands.
