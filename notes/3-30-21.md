# Back from spring break and with working wifi!

Today's goal is to plot average distances (boxplot, distrabution? something
along those lines) of all R-loop initiation sites which I am just defining
as the start of R-loop peaks to GLOE-seq reads (break sites).

Have written R script that inputs bed file of footloop peaks and truncates
them to 1bp length from the start position. Then can use bedtools closest
without having to deal with intersections. Additionally, since reads that tie
in distance are all reported can also get proxy of number of reads. Although
this could be an issue if there are two breaks up and downstream at same
distance.

Also want to look at the read depth distribution for all nicks.

Also want to look at the read depth of R-loop initiation sites compared to the
depth of break reads.
