# Some wrangling

Downloaded DRIP browser tracks from 
[UCSC genome browswer](http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/fredericchedinlab/hg19_DRIP_correlation)
Downloaded the HeLa cell stuff since the GLOE seq people also did
their work in some kind of cancer cell line. Those files are all downloaded
through the Snakemake file. 

# Working on snakes

Working on snakemake pipeline made couple choices.

Created R script for "peak calling" so can use bed tools intersect without
intersecting everything. The script will pull out regions whos values are
\>= 3 standard deviations from the mean. 

However looking at GLOE seq files resolution seems to be 1 to 10 kp (???)

Maybe I am looking at the wrong files or might need to acutally run the
pipeline.

Originally was thinking I would need to intersect each DRIP file against
each GLOE file one at a time but I think doing an intersection for each
DRIP against *all* GLOE files with `-wa` and `-wb` should work in the same
way. This still does not address the resolution issue or help determine
which samples are which.
