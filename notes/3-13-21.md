# Some wrangling

Downloaded DRIP browser tracks from 
[UCSC genome browswer](http://genome.ucsc.edu/s/fredericchedinlab/hg19_DRIP_correlation)
Downloaded the HeLa cell stuff since the GLOE seq people also did
their work in some kind of cancer cell line. Those files are all downloaded
through the Snakemake file. 

# Working on snakes

Working on snakemake pipeline made couple choices.

Created R script for "peak calling" so can use bed tools intersect without
intersecting everything. The script will pull out regions whos values are
\>= 3 standard deviations from the mean. 

However looking at GLOE seq files resolution seems to be 1 to 10 kp (???)

Maybe I am looking at the wrong files or might need to acutally run the
pipeline.

Originally was thinking I would need to intersect each DRIP file against
each GLOE file one at a time but I think doing an intersection for each
DRIP against *all* GLOE files with `-wa` and `-wb` should work in the same
way. This still does not address the resolution issue or help determine
which samples are which.


# Weirdness in GLOE files

Looks like at least one of the GLOE files has negative values in it. 
Maybe they where normalized?

This seems to be why, using deeptools for something related to replication forks

```
Supplementary_files_format_and_content: BigWig files based on replication fork directionality (RFD) ratio (RFD = (REV â€“ FWD)/(REV + FWD)) were generated using deepTools (version 3.1.0) bigwigCompare program (parameter: -bs 1000 or 10000).
```

**Based on that I do not think we actually want to be using these sup files.**
