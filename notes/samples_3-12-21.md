# Figuring out sample stuff

Currently trying to figure out what samples are which and what all these
bigwig files represent. 

Downloaded all files from GLOE-seq paper GEO id [at this link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE134225)
and got directory full of bigwig files which I am guessing are some
kind of representation of the break points but not really sure
how to interpret these yet.
