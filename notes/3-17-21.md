# Pushing on with snakemake

Was reading through the protocol paper again and came across this line
which I missed earlier.

```
bed: this directory contains a BED file for each sample (SAMPLE_NAME.bed). In the indirect mode,
these files list the coordinates of the nucleotide upstream and on the opposite strand of the 5 0 -end
of each mapped read. In the direct mode, they list the first nucleotide on the strand opposite the
5 0 -end of each mapped read. The information in these BED files is further filtered to produce files
that contain counts for breaks that map exclusively to the plus (SAMPLE_NAME.fwd.bed) or the
minus (SAMPLE_NAME.rev.bed) strand.
```

The snakemake pipeline has produced output for the files mentioned above so
I thought I would try and go ahead and compare these to the DRIP seq data since
I am still having issues getting the GLOE-seq pipeline to run correctly
with the test data. 

## Adjustments to R-loop calling

Made some adjustments to R-loop identification from DRIP data by adding
bedtools `merge` that merges signals within ~75 bp. This was to prevent
individual bases (or short runs of 10) being mapped as whole loops.

## Adding plotting

Added script to plot the distribution of min distances from each R loop structure
to the nearest nick.

## Future

I think it would make sense to do some kind of peak calling with macs2 using
the ligase inhibited samples as controls. This in theory should eliminate
okazaki fragment nicks. The utility of this is only if Okazaki fragment nicks
could be detected in the first place from the control sample which I am not
sure is the case
