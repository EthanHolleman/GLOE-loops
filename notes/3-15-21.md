## Fixing SAM commands

Looks like mapping worked but some of the 
sorting commands failed.

Fix bug `samtooms` -> `samtools` :)

Seems like typo was causing error but output
files were still produced because just taken
from standard output (would produce empty file)

Size of sam / bam files produced ~= 100 GB each

## Adapters

Need to find what adapters where used in sequencing for human cells
from GLOE-seq paper

Trimmomatic has standard adapters included with it including the one
we are looking for see 
[this link](https://github.com/timflutre/trimmomatic/blob/master/adapters/TruSeq3-SE.fa)

Added the trim rule with same parameters used by GLOE-seq pipeline
