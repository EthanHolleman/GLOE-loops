# More Bowtie Stuff

## Fixing SAM commands

Looks like mapping worked but some of the 
sorting commands failed.

Fix bug `samtooms` -> `samtools` :)

Seems like typo was causing error but output
files were still produced because just taken
from standard output (would produce empty file)

Size of sam / bam files produced ~= 100 GB each

## Adapters

Need to find what adapters where used in sequencing for human cells
from GLOE-seq paper

Trimmomatic has standard adapters included with it including the one
we are looking for see 
[this link](https://github.com/timflutre/trimmomatic/blob/master/adapters/TruSeq3-SE.fa)

Added the trim rule with same parameters used by GLOE-seq pipeline

## Strand reversal 

All strand orrientation operations seem to be
handled by GLOE-pipeline bam2bed scripts which
call perl scripts and some awk stuff. 

Made rules for those and added to snakefile but have
not connected them to anything yet. But in theory at
that point should be able to convert to bed file
(if not already) and intersect them with the
DRIP data.
