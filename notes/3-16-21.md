# Running perl scripts in pipeline

Today just did a bit of work on getting the perl scripts taken from
the `GLOEPipe` pipeline. Ended up breaking the commands up into many more
rules to debug and determine which was throwing errors.

Fixed some issues that were caused by different quirks required to get
the `awk` commands to run in the Snakemake setting.

After some debugging the pipeline seems to be running and so I made some
adjustments to the output format and starting rerunning everything except
the sequence downloads.

```
Job counts:
        count   jobs
        1       all
        2       bam_to_bed
        2       get_second_column_indirect
        2       indirect_big_awk
        2       indirect_mode
        2       map_reads
        2       sam_to_bam
        2       sort_bam
        2       sort_indirect_mode
        2       sort_trimmed_bam
        2       trim_bam_bad_alignments
        2       trimmomatic
        23
```

Currently running for the two human cell control samples (untreated with no
lipase knockouts). This should give idea of where spontaneous nick hot spots
are located.
